What about intelletual property? if I want to make it a product, would it be better if I can keep the data generation part in a separate private repo?

Yes, separating the data generation part into a private repository would be a better approach if you're concerned about intellectual property and want to make this a product. Here's why:

1. Protection of proprietary algorithms : Your data scraping/collection logic might contain valuable algorithms or methods that you don't want to expose publicly.
2. API keys and credentials : If your data collection script uses any paid APIs or requires authentication, keeping these credentials private is essential.
3. Business logic separation : Keeping your core business logic (data collection) separate from the presentation layer (the web app) follows good architectural practices.
You could structure it like this:

1. Private Repository : Contains your data collection scripts, any proprietary algorithms, and potentially a GitHub Action that:
   
   - Runs your data collection scripts
   - Processes the data
   - Generates the CSV files
   - Pushes the CSV files to your public repository using a GitHub token
2. Public Repository : Contains only your React application and the CSV data files (which are just the end results, not the valuable collection logic).
This way, users can see and use your application, but the valuable intellectual property of how you gather and process the data remains protected. The GitHub Action in your private repo can be set up to automatically update the public repo's data files on a schedule.
